# Challenge

The goal in this challenge is to find the correlation between avg, fare and total rides for each of the city type and determine if there is any statistical significance between the city types.

Pyber Analysis Scatter and Pie charts, summary of key metrics of the ride data for each city type and a multi-line graph to show the total fare for each city type on a weekly basis.

**Summary Table**


The Summary Table presents the Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver for each city type (Rural, Suburban, Urban) from the Pyber database. You can observe that the total number of rides and drivers are relatively low for rural areas and it progressively increases towards high traffic locations I.e Urban and Suburban areas. Urban Cities show 13 times more rides than Rural cities and the number of drivers in Urban cities is around 31 times higher as compared to the Rural numbers. The total fare for Urban is about 9 times as that in Rural. This is responsible for the lower averages in Urban cities. Average fare per driver in Rural areas is $55.49 which is 3.34 times more than that of Urban. This implies that the rides in the Urban areas are relatively shorter than that in Rural areas.


For a driver in a Rural city, the average are per ride and the average fare per driver is much higher than other city types. The Rural cities are the most profitable on a per ride basis inspirt of not being a favorite with the Drivers.

**Total Fare by Each City Type on a weekly basis**

The graph brings to light the total fare for each City Type the period from 01/01/2019. Rural fare is represented in Blue, Suburban in Red and Urban in yellow.The seasonal variation in the total fare for suburban follows a similar patters starting in Jan and Feb and then increases by end of Feb till April. The graph shows the total fare for Rural cities stays lower than total fare for suburbans.. The Urban areas have the highest in the entire period. Weekly fare varies between $0 to $500 for Rural, between $750 to $1500 for Suburban and Urban between $1800 to  $2700.Sometimes Urban’s fare is as much as 5 times that of Rural’s. Highest revenue generators are Urban cities, which can be explained by larger population and busy traffic spread across a large time period.
